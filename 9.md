## You are a badass

be vigilant
take the first right step
do your best whenever you can
do not reinvent the wheel
do not get caught in the thunder bird height
listen to your intuition
look deeper into your fantacies
Love yourself


Learn to meditate (sitting still and thinking about nothing)
Learn to give

HOw to get over your bs already

Do not become a slave to procrastination

Fear is always a choice, it is instilled within us from a very young age

view fear from the rear view mirror
always try
be in the moment
caught off the stream of crap
do not think of anything not rewarding at night
love yourself

Commit to your decision

expand your beliefs of what you are what

the only limits we have in life are the ones we place on ourselves
